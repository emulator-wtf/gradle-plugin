# emulator.wtf Gradle Plugin

Emulator.wtf is an Android cloud emulator laser-focused on performance to
deliver quick feedback to your PRs.

With this Gradle plugin you can run your Android instrumentation tests with
[emulator.wtf](https://emulator.wtf).

## Running

The plugin will add new Gradle tasks for each testable Android variant with the
name `test${variant.name.capitalize()}WithEmulatorWtf`. A few examples:

- `testDebugWithEmulatorWtf` - a simple app with `debug` and `release`
  buildtypes
- `testFreeDebugWithEmulatorWtf`, `testPaidDebugWithEmulatorWtf` - an app having
  a single flavor dimension with `free` and `paid`.

In addition to the variant specific tasks there will be an anchor task named
`testWithEmulatorWtf`, it'll depend on _all_ the variant-specific tasks. This allows
you to run all tests for all subprojects with a single `./gradlew testWithEmulatorWtf`
invoke. See the configuration section below on disabling the task for some variants.

You can always run `./gradlew :app:tasks` to see the added tasks, they will be
listed under the _Verification_ section.

## Installation

### Using plugins DSL (`plugins {}`)

Make sure `mavenCentral()` repository is in your `settings.gradle` file:

```groovy
pluginManagement {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/" }
  }
}
```

And then you can enable the plugin by adding it to the `plugins` block of your
app project (usually under `app/build.gradle`):

```groovy
plugins {
  id "wtf.emulator.gradle" version "0.16.2"
}
```

### Using `buildscript` classpath (`apply plugin`)

Add the emulator.wtf plugin to your `buildscript` classpath in the root
`build.gradle` file:

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    google()
    mavenCentral()
  }
  
  dependencies {
    // ... other deps here, like com.android.tools.build:gradle
    classpath "wtf.emulator:gradle-plugin:0.16.2"
  }
}
```

You can then apply the plugin in your app project (usually in `app/build.gradle`):

```groovy
apply plugin: 'wtf.emulator.gradle'
```

### Token

To run tests you'll need to pass your API token to the Gradle plugin. The
recommended way to do so is via defining a `EW_API_TOKEN` environment variable,
it'll get picked up by the plugin automatically. This way you don't have to
worry about passing the token to your Gradle build.

Alternatively, you can use the `token` option on the `emulatorwtf` extension.
For example, to grab the token via a `ewApiToken` project property:

```groovy
emulatorwtf {
  token = project.properties.ewApiToken
}
```

NOTE: hardcoding API tokens in your `build.gradle` files is not recommended.

## Configuration

The `emulatorwtf` plugin DSL supports the following configuration options:

```groovy
emulatorwtf {
  // CLI version to use, defaults to 0.11.0
  version = '0.11.0'

  // emulator.wtf API token, we recommend either using the EW_API_TOKEN env var
  // instead of this or passing this value in via a project property
  token = 'AQAA...'

  // where to store results in, they will be further scoped by the variant name,
  // i.e. ./gradlew :app:testFreeDebugWithEmulatorWtf will store outputs in
  // build/build-results/freeDebug
  baseOutputDir = layout.buildDirectory.dir("build-results")

  // Specify what kind of outputs to store in the base output dir
  // default: [OutputType.MERGED_RESULTS_XML, OutputType.COVERAGE, OutputType.PULLED_DIRS]
  outputs = [OutputType.SUMMARY, OutputType.CAPTURED_VIDEO, OutputType.LOGCAT]

  // Always print the ew-cli output the console when running. Useful for debugging.
  printOutput = true

  // record a video of the test run
  recordVideo = true

  // ignore test failures and keep running the build, defaults to false
  //
  // NOTE: the build outcome _will_ be success at the end, use the JUnit XML files to
  //       check for test failures
  ignoreFailures = false

  // devices to test on, Defaults to [[model: 'Pixel2', version: 27]]
  devices = [
    [model: 'NexusLowRes', version: 30, atd: true],
    [model: 'Pixel2', version: 23]
  ]

  // Set the test timeout, defaults to 15 minutes
  timeout = Duration.ofHours(1)

  // whether to enable Android orchestrator, if your app has orchestrator
  // configured this will get picked up automatically, however you can
  // force-change the value here if you want to
  useOrchestrator = true
  
  // whether to clear package data before running each test (orchestrator only)
  // if your app has this configured via testInstrumentationRunnerArguments then
  // it will get picked up automatically
  clearPackageData = true
  
  // if true, the Gradle plugin will fetch coverage data and store under
  // `baseOutputDir/${variant}`, if your app has coverage enabled this will be
  // enabled automatically
  withCoverage = true

  // additional APKs to install, you can pass in `project.files(...)` or a 
  // Gradle configuration here
  additionalApks = configurations.additionalTestApks
  
  // additional arguments to AndroidJUnitRunner, by default emulator.wtf Gradle
  // plugin will pick these up from testInstrumentationRunnerArguments, however
  // you can override (or unset with null) these values here
  // 
  // for instance to only run medium tests:
  environmentVariables = [size: 'medium']

  // Set to the a minutes value to split your tests into multiple shards
  // dynamically, the number of shards will be figured out based on historical
  // test times. This is a good way to ensure a consistent runtime as your
  // testsuite grows or shrinks - we will adjust the number of shards as
  // needed
  shardTargetRuntime = 2

  // Set to a number larger than 1 to randomly split your tests into multiple
  // shards to be executed in parallel
  numUniformShards = 3
  
  // Set to a number larger than 1 to split your tests into multiple shards
  // based on test counts to be executed in parallel
  numShards = 3

  // Set to a number larger than 1 to split your tests into multiple shards
  // based on historic test time to be executed in parallel
  numBalancedShards = 3

  // Set to a non-zero value to repeat device/shards that failed, the repeat
  // attempts will be executed in parallel
  numFlakyTestAttempts = 3

  // Whether to reattempt full shards (all) or only failed tests (failed_only)
  // in case of test failures. Defaults to failed_only.
  flakyTestRepeatMode = failed_only

  // Directories to pull from device after test is over, will be stored in
  // baseOutputDir/${variant}:
  diretoriesToPull = ['/sdcard/screenshots']

  // Enable-disable the test input file cache (APKs etc)
  fileCacheEnabled = false

  // Set the maximum time-to-live of items in the test input file cache
  fileCacheTtl = Duration.ofHours(3)

  // Disable caching test results in the backend
  // NOTE! This will not disable caching at the Gradle task or Gradle build cache level,
  // use sideEffects = true to disable all caching
  testCacheEnabled = false
  
  // Continue after triggering the tests. No outputs will be saved.
  async = true
  
  // Manually set the displayName of the tests. Defaults to the module path + variant name (if there
  // are multiple testable variants)
  displayName = "instrumentation tests"

  // Filter to specific test targets to run, these will be forwarded to the 'am instrument ...' command
  // Read more at https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/test/runner/AndroidJUnitRunner#typical-usage
  // default: all tests will be run
  testTargets = "class foo.bar.Baz"

  // Do not generate the test task for some specific variants
  variantFilter {
    if (variant.buildType.name == 'release') {
      enabled = false
    }
  }

  // Configure a HTTP proxy to use when making requests to emulator.wtf API
  // these values default to standard JVM system properties `http.proxyHost`,
  // `http.proxyPort`, `http.proxyUser` and `http.proxyPassword` - there's no need to specify
  // them if your Gradle daemon has these props set.
  // NOTE: this is for setting up the test, it has no effect on your tests in the emulator
  proxyHost = "localhost"
  proxyPort = 8080
  proxyUser = "user"
  proxyPassword = "hunter2"
}
```

## Common examples

### Run tests with multiple device profiles

By default, emulator.wtf runs tests on a Pixel2-like emulator with API 27
(Android 8.1). If you want to run on a different version or device profile you
can specify devices like so:

```groovy
emulatorwtf {
  devices = [
    [model: "NexusLowRes", version: 23],
    [model: "Pixel2", version: 27]
  ]
}
```

### Run tests with shards

The following example runs tests in parallel using 3 separate shards and stores
the outputs from each shard in a separate folder under `app/build/test-results`:

```groovy
emulatorwtf {
  numshards = 3
}
```

## Compatibility

The plugin is compatible with any working combination of these ranges:
