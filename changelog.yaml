  Breaking: specifying devices has changed. Instead of `devices` you can now specify devices to run tests on with
  repeated `device {}` blocks. Example:
  ```groovy
  emulatorwtf {
      device {
          model = DeviceModel.PIXEL_2
          version = 29
      }
      device {
          model = DeviceModel.NEXUS_LOW_RES
          version = 21
      }
  }
  ```

  Breaking: `flakyTestRepeatMode` argument now takes a `FlakyRepeatMode` enum value instead of a string. Example:
  ```groovy
  emulatorwtf {
      flakyTestRepeatMode = FlakyRepeatMode.ALL
  }
  ```
