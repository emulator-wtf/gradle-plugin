  When applied to Android projects the emulator.wtf Gradle plugin now automatically adds the
  [`wtf.emulator:test-runtime-android`](https://github.com/emulator-wtf/test-runtime-android) dependency to the
  `androidTestImplementation` configuration to enable per-test video captures. You can disable this by adding
  `wtf.emulator.addruntimedependency=false` to your `gradle.properties` file.
